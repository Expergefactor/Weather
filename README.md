# WHAT IS IT?
This software is designed to be used with weather station data and provides a total of 14 analytics:
  * 11 public (outdoor)
  * 3 private (indoor)

You have the option of generating a full report (from the main menu) which conducts analytics on all datasets or, conducting a single report (from the sub menu using option 4) for an individual dataset.

# HOW TO USE IT
  * Put all original weather station files into folder: "database/original/"
  * Use option 2 to compile all weather station files into a single database
  * Now you can use functions 3 & 4
  * Keep adding more weather station files and use option 2 to ingest them into the working database
